In this class we will revise the structures used to describe our skills and what we like doing.

We will also work with the Simple Past Tense of verbs, which is very important when describing an experience.

## :star:  Speaking. Talking about your skills

When choosing a job, it’s useful to have clear in your mind the things you are good at.

1. Look at these people talking about the things they are good at, and the things they enjoy
doing.

2. Now think about yourself. Answer these questions:

What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing?

Write your answers in the table below. Then share them in class.

wrong.

## :star: Reading comprehension

4. Let your body do the talking.

We use spoken language all the time, but we also ‘speak’ using our face, our eyes, our hands and the way we sit
and stand. The way we use our bodies to communicate is called body language. Body language is not the same in
all countries.

**a- Read the article below quickly. Which paragraph tells people what to do in interviews?**

-> The second paragraph.

**b- What does the writer say about these things?**

- body language in different parts of the world

- body language for men and women


**c- What does the writer say about body language in an interview?**

**d- In what ways is body language in your culture different to the ideas in the text?**

---

## :star: Speaking: Going for an interview.

5. After reading the text, do we know what to do at an interview?

In an interview, body language and the way you behave are also important.
Let’s think and talk about the points below and decide which you must do and which you mustn’t do at
an interview in our country. Make a list.
