### Soft Skills Needed For Graduate Technology Jobs

As well as techy “hard skills” necessary for particular technology jobs, there are a number of other IT jobs requirements and skills necessary if you want to work in the tech sector. Given the fast-paced, ever-evolving nature of technology, these “soft skills” will be valuable in every graduate technology job.

1 ........Planning/organization

Whatever role you’re working in, good organizational skills are vital. Given that you’re likely to be working on a range of different tasks, the ability to organize your work and prioritize your time will be of real value to any graduate tech employer.

2 .........Motivation

To work in the technology industry, motivation and drive will be key. It’s especially important to be able to self-motivate when you might be working autonomously on projects, rather than relying on a Manager or Team Lead to keep you focused.


3 .........Interpersonal skills

Many people mistakenly think that jobs in tech involve solely hiding behind a computer screen and don’t require communication skills. This is not true, however, you will need to communicate with other people in the business; who will often be a mix of technical and non-technical users. In order to excel in any graduate tech role, communication, interpersonal and teamworking skills are important.


4 ........Attention to detail

Whether you’re working as a Graduate Software Developer or a Client Services Executive, attention to detail is vital when working to tight deadlines. Tech companies, especially tech startups, tend to be extremely fast paced, so employers require precision, pace and accuracy across every team in their business.
