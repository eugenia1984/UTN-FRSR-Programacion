# :book: Tiempos verbales (12 Mayo)

---

Seguimos trabajando en el contexto de la Frase o Grupo Verbal.

Mira la siguiente imágen para retomar esta idea.

## Grupo verbal : predicado

Conjunto de palabras que tiene como núcleo un verbo que tiene como modificadores un adverbio, preposiciones, conjunciones y complementos.

Como verás, este grupo es muy importante en una oración. Ya vimos las distintas formas que puede tomar el verbo **To be**. Ahora veremos las **distintas formas y tiempos verbales** de los verbos distintos al verbo to be.

Antes de comenzar, es muy importante recordar la estructura de la oración en inglés. Estas se pueden representar de la siguente forma:

- Para la forma afirmativa, sería: **S + V + Complemento**

**s** ->sujeto

**v** -> verbo

- Para la forma negativa, la estructura sería: **S + (aux+not)V + Complemento**

En donde, a diferencia de la afirmativa, necesitamos un **auxiliar** (aux) y la partícula negativa **not** antes del verbo.

- Para la forma interrogativa, es importante recordar que se produce una inversión en el orden del auxiliar y del sujeto. : **Wh-+Aux+S + V + Complemento**

Es decir, en las preguntas la palabra interrogativa (Wh-) y el auxiliar van antes que el sujeto.

Teniendo claro este detalle, trabajaremos de manera habitual:

1- Descarga la Guía teórica. Y puedes encontrar un cuadro de verbos aquí

2- Mira el video con la explicación [aca](http://campus.frsr.utn.edu.ar/moodle/pluginfile.php/65789/mod_page/content/6/5-%20Tiempos%20Verbales.mp4)

3- Resuelve el cuestionario del módulo.

## :star: Guía Teórica

**TIEMPOS VERBALES**

 

Los verbos en inglés se mencionan en infinitivo con la partícula to.

Ejemplo:	

to work	-> trabajar, funcionar

to provide -> proveer, suministrar

El sistema verbal en inglés es mucho más simple que el castellano, ya que en casi todos los tiempos verbales el verbo es igual para todas las personas (por eso es obligatorio poner siempre un sujeto).
Veamos cómo cambiaría un ejemplo según el tiempo verbal utilizado.
